melange/__init__ has start of app/canvas ... needs to be worked out properly
and hooked up with 'melange run'


In a python shell can import like:

import melange
dir(melange)


an 'app' should provide a canvas instance...  'main.py' should have the
imports for this - maybe you get something like:

import melange.app

@melange.app
def draw(canvas):
    im = canvas.image(0, 0, "http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/581/567/bab.jpg")
    im.draw()  ## not sure on any of this syntax yet


--- thing is; working out the decorators, started trying to use wrapt
    to get decorators that can optionally take params, but doesn't seem
    to work fully ?


- Need to make 'melange run' pick a client/renderer and run this
- Implement 'image'  see also
